# Scala-KNN
In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric classification method. 
It is used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in a data set. 
Scala map is a collection of key/value pairs. Any value can be retrieved based on its key. Keys are unique in the Map, but values need not be unique.
